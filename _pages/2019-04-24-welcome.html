<p style="text-align:center;">Alys Murray is an author who writes for the romantic in all of us. Though she graduated with a degree in Drama from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts and a Master’s in Film Studies from King’s College London, her irrepressible love of romance led her to a career as an author, and she couldn’t be happier to write these stories!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Her debut novel, <em>The Christmas Company</em>, will be adapted as a film in Hallmark Channel’s 2019 Countdown to Christmas. Alys loves connecting with readers, so if you want to get in touch, you can find her at www.alysmurray.com or on twitter at @writeralys. She is represented by Rebecca Angus of Golden Wheat Literary, <a href="https://www.rebeccaangusbooks.com/contact">so please contact her with any business inquiries!</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Currently splitting time between her home state of Louisiana and London, she enjoys kissing books, <em>Star Wars</em>, and traveling. Tobey Maguire is her Spider-Man.</p>
