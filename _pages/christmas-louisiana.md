The Winter Family is Christmas royalty in New Iberia, Louisiana, and Sarah Winter (Jana Kramer), a successful lawyer and former Miss Christmas, is no exception. When she returns home to celebrate the anniversary of the town’s Sugarcane Christmas Festival with her mother (Moira Kelly) and her grandparents (Dee Wallace and Barry Bostwick), she rediscovers the magic of the season–and a little romance– with her former Mister Christmas, Luke (Percy Daggs III).

_Premiering on November 28, 2019 as part of Lifetime's It's a Wonderful Lifetime season, Alys co-wrote the screenplay of Christmas in Louisiana with Emily Moss Wilson_
