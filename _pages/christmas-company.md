_\*\*Soon to be a Hallmark Channel Countdown to Christmas movie!\*\*_

_The Christmas Company_ is a modern, romantic take on the “Christmas Carol” story. After inheriting his uncle’s company, Clark Woodward wants to shut down the Christmas festival his family owns, seeing it as a waste of money and resources. However, the plucky festival assistant, Kate Buckner, isn’t about to let someone take away the festival that’s so important to their town. So, she resolves to show him the magic of Christmas and win the festival back.
