Hello, dear reader!

My name is Alys Murray and welcome to my website! Here, you’ll find everything there is to find about me: links to my social media pages, information about my books, and even some fun bonus content on my blog! I’m represented by Rebecca Angus of Golden Wheat Literary, so if you’re looking for my representation, you can reach out to her here!     

Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, I went to New York University for my undergraduate degree. After spending my first two years studying at Playwright’s Horizons Theatre School in Tisch, I finished the rest of my education at NYU’s London campus, where I studied playwriting under the Writers’ Guild of Great Britain. After that, I followed my love of movies and pursued my Masters’ in Film Studies at King’s College London, where I finished with honors after completing a thesis on contemporary Hollywood depictions of post-Katrina New Orleans.

But enough of the boring stuff! I love Star Wars! I love Hallmark movies! I love romance novels! I love Brendan Fraser! Tobey Maguire is my Spider-Man! Michael Bay has two films in the Criterion Collection! I’m an avid cook and baker, and have company over for big meals and parties any chance I get. If you’ve got a great recipe, please send it my way! I also love love and love stories, generally. During my time in London, I met and fell in love with my own British Prince, and we got married in the summer of 2019. Exciting stuff, huh?

As a kid, I was a voracious reader, devouring everything from The Princess Diaries to Great Expectations.  I started writing my own stories, plays, and fanfiction and developed a love for storytelling. Getting to write professionally is a dream come true, and when you read my books, I hope they make you as happy as writing them has made me.

If you ever have any questions, want to chat about my books or just say hello, you can reach me on any of my social media pages or at the email address on my contact page. I love connecting with readers and hope to hear from you soon!

With love and happy reading,

Alys
