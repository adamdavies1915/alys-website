<p>It's the holiday season, which means one thing above all else: this is the time of year when slogans and cheesy inspirational sayings are all the rage. Phrases like, "the best present is being present," and "a goal without a plan is just a dream," permeate our cultural consciousness as people come together to celebrate their religious holidays and the New Year.</p>
<p>Last year, at the end of 2017, I was preparing to sign a contract with my first (and only!) literary agent and was eagerly awaiting feedback from Hallmark Publishing on my recent submission, <em>The Christmas Company. </em>And during my first meeting with Rebecca Angus (my lovely agent), I remember her asking, "What are your goals?"</p>
<p>At the time, this question <em>completely </em>caught me off guard. As an extremely new author, I figured that the goals were to get an agent and to get published, right? I had vague dreams of seeing my book on the shelf in a real store, but other than that, I hadn't the slightest clue.</p>
<p>A little embarrassed at not having a real answer for her, after we finished our phone call, I picked up the nearest notebook and pen and scribbled at the top of my notebook: WRITING GOALS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. I wrote those out, and they included some of those pipe dreams of mine, such as being on the shelf in a bookstore and getting a starred review in a trade publication, but they also included more concrete things, such as "Write a high-fantasy romance," and "Write that World War II Romance I've Always wanted to Write."</p>
<p>With those goals in mind, I turned to another page and wrote, in big, scrawling letters, "GOALS FOR 2018." And before I wrote <em>those</em> down, I decided to only write down the ones that would help me get to my goals that I had set out for the next five years. My 2018 were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish four full-length novels (or three fulls and a novella).</li>
<li>Sell all three books already submitted to Rebecca.</li>
<li>Find a critique partner and solicit feedback on each of the completed manuscripts.</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-121" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/46510730_10156964231619225_6689155643598700544_n.jpg" alt="46510730_10156964231619225_6689155643598700544_n" width="960" height="718" />And you know what, reader? As of yesterday, I accomplished <em>all</em> of those writing goals! I posted on twitter about finishing my fourth manuscript of the year yesterday, and after a few inquiring DM's and tweets, I thought that I would share with you how I did it in the hopes that maybe it will also help you in 2019!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step One</span>: Planning for 2019 Actually Begins in 2018. </strong></p>
<p>In order to get the most out of your year, I highly recommend sitting down sometime between now and The New Year to plan your writing year for 2018. This way, you can hit the ground running on January first and go into the year with a plan in mind. In the frantic rush of the holiday season, I know it's difficult to find time for yourself and your writing career, but trust me on this. Taking fifteen minutes before bed every night for a few nights to plot out your future will be extremely beneficial to your 2019 productivity.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step Two</span>: Creating Realistic Goals is Key. </strong></p>
<p>Everyone is different and every writer is different. As a grad student who had her mornings free to freelance and work on her books, I was lucky enough to have the time to write as much as I did this year, but the same might not be realistic if I was working a full-time job or if I had a house full of children! The key to making goals and keeping them is to know your limits, know your schedule, and push only a little bit further than you're comfortable going. Your mental health, time with your family, and overall well-being is NOT worth a little bit of social media street cred, so when you make your goals, ensure that they're realistic for you and your situation. Nothing makes you want to give up on your goals faster than thinking they are impossible.</p>
<p>Also, make sure your goals are specific. In my goals, I specifically wrote out that I wanted all of my full-length novels to be over 60,000 words, and this helped with planning my writing schedule!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step Three</span>: Build an Action Plan and Write it Out</strong></p>
<p>After I made my realistic goals, I sat down with my 2018 calendar and blocked out my "no writing days." This included things like my birthday, visits home when I didn't want to spend time away from my family to write, Christmas, etc., and these days were vital to keeping me on track. By knowing what days I <em>wouldn't</em> be writing, I was able to calculate how many days I did have to write.  This was especially important for me because from July to the beginning of October, I had a dissertation to write for my Master's program, which meant no fiction writing for me!</p>
<p>From there, I made a chart in my notebook about what <em>kinds</em> of books I wanted to write. I knew I wanted to write two sweet romances around 70,000 words and two longer works around 85,000 words, and knowing that meant I was able to better plan out what book I would be writing when.</p>
<p>With my calendar (and the help of Scrivener's word count/deadline tool!), I mapped out my "deadlines" for each book, writing out how much time I would budget for brainstorming and note-carding, as well as how much time I would budget for writing. Once this was completed, I had a full writing plan for the year. For example, below is the blocked out writing period for <em>Edge of a Star</em>, the first novel I wrote in 2018.</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-120 alignnone" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2018-12-21-at-12.03.03-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-12-21 at 12.03.03 PM" width="1536" height="1112" /></p>
<p>The action plan includes both the calendar portion, but also a word count plan, so that every day you know exactly how many words you're writing in order to stay on track. Scrivener has been a huge help for me in this regard, but you can do it any way that's helpful to you!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step Four:</span> Find an Accountability Partner</strong></p>
<p>Some people use twitter, some people use their fiancé's, but everyone should have an accountability partner! Basically, at the beginning of 2018, I asked my fiancé to ask me, every day when he got home, how many words I'd written, if I'd met my writing goal, and what I'd written that day. Not only did it give us good dinner conversation, but it also helped me stay accountable and helped me stay excited about the work I was doing.</p>
<p>Further, on days when I <em>didn't</em> meet my writing goal (or days when I didn't write at all!), it was nice to have someone to talk to about it, so I wasn't stuck in my own head. Having a support system is incredibly important to achieving your goals!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step Five</span>: Find the Strategies that Work for You and for the Book (or Project!) You're Writing</strong></p>
<p>Every book is a special snowflake. Or, perhaps more accurately, every book is a complex puzzle crafted by the devil to make us work hard. But, either way, part of achieving your goals is making sure you know how to approach that book! For me, the two things that helped were</p>
<ol>
<li>Creating a rough outline of the shape of the book, even if that shape was, "These are the 20,000 words were they meet,  these are the 40,000 words were they go on a quest together and fall in love, and these are the 20,000 words where he succumbs to his hubris, screws things up and they have a war but also eventually fall back in love."</li>
<li>Making a stack of notecards, each one representing a different chapter in the book. Because I know how long my chapters tend to be (2,300 to 3,000 words on the long end,) I can usually track how many chapters a given novel with a given word count tend to have. This means that I can create a stack of notecards wherein each notecard represents a chapter and has information about that chapter written on it. (Usually the chapter number, the character POV of that chapter, and a brief description of the conflict of that chapter and what each character is trying to get out of that scene.) These come in handy when I'm stuck or have writer's block, because it means that I can remind myself of where the story is moving or allow myself to go and work on a different chapter since I know I can always come back to chapters I've skipped!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step Six:</span> Work Hard, but Forgive Yourself </strong></p>
<p>This has been the hardest lesson I have had to teach myself. When you set a goal, it can feel like the end of the world to fall behind. I always get very blame-y, which often leads to me writing when I'm ill or on a train (or on my phone in the bathroom of my fiancé's family's house while we're trying to have a family dinner...), but let me tell you right now: if you don't want to get burned out and lose sight of your goals completely, you have to learn to forgive yourself and how to let go of those temporary hiccups. Tomorrow is another day to tell your story, and you can absolutely seize that opportunity!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-122" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/46107043_10156935460534225_7664218141546774528_n.jpg" alt="46107043_10156935460534225_7664218141546774528_n" width="768" height="960" /></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Step Seven</span>: Celebrate All of Your Success!</strong></p>
<p>By December 31 this year, I will have written 346, 216 words, across five manuscripts, four of which are completed. If I include my dissertation, that number becomes 362,967 words. And that's so exciting! It's incredible to feel that I wrote so much, especially considering that this time last year, I didn't know if anyone would even want to read what I wrote!</p>
<p>But, the real thing to celebrate isn't how many books you write or how many words you get on the page. The real thing to celebrate is the goals you make and the goals you keep! Best of luck to all of you in this new year and happy writing! I can't wait to see all of the wonderful things you create in 2019!</p>
