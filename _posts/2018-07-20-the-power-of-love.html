<p>Hello, dear reader!</p>
<p>No, we're not talking about Huey Lewis and The News today. For this, my inaugural blog post and in preparation for the release of my debut, <em>The Christmas Company</em>, I thought I would answer a simple question: Why do I write romance novels?</p>
<p>On the surface, it's an easy enough question to answer. I write romance because I read romance. A lot of romance. I write romance because romance novels are what I know. They're my favorite and people gravitate towards their favorites.</p>
<p>But, of course, there's more to it than just liking romance. But liking romance novels is the start. To me, the appeal of the romance novel is that it is an unabashed declaration of the importance of joy. Each book is a 300-page assertion that happiness and love matter, no matter what a cynical world may say.</p>
<p>When I was a little girl, we used to sing this song at school. It went, "Let there be peace on Earth and let it begin with me." And <em>that</em> is the reason I write romance novels. I write love stories because every time someone reads one, a little bit more hope and faith and optimism is put out into the universe.</p>
<p>And that's the power of love.</p>
